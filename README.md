# Deep Learning Course Projects

This repository contains various homework assignments from my Deep Learning course. Each assignment covers different aspects of deep learning, from classification tasks to advanced techniques such as semi-supervised learning and object detection. Below is an overview of the contents of each assignment folder.

## Homework Assignments

### A2 - Binary and Multi-Class Classification
- **Binary Classification**: Implementation and training of models to distinguish between two classes.
- **Multi-Class Classification**: Extension of classification tasks to handle more than two classes.

### A3 - Semi-Supervised Flower Classification
- **Flower Classification**: A semi-supervised learning approach to classify images of flowers, utilizing both labeled and unlabeled data to improve model performance.

### A4 - Rotation Task and Model Fine-Tuning
- **Rotation Task Training**: Training a model to recognize the correct orientation of images.
- **Fine-Tuning on Pre-Trained Model**: Fine-tuning a model pre-trained on a large dataset.
- **Fine-Tuning on Randomly Initialized Model**: Training and fine-tuning a model with random initial weights.
- **Supervised Learning on Pre-Trained Model**: Applying supervised learning techniques on a pre-trained model.
- **Supervised Learning on Randomly Initialized Model**: Applying supervised learning techniques on a model with random initial weights.

### A5 - YOLOv1
- **YOLOv1**: Implementation of the YOLOv1 (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm to detect objects within images.

### A6 - Text Sentiment Classification and Language Model Tasks
- **Text Sentiment Classification**: Classifying text data based on sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).
- **In-Context Learning**: Exploring in-context learning methods.
- **LM-BFF (Language Model - Best Friend Forever)**: Implementing techniques to enhance language model performance.
